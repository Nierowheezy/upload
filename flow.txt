When the user click on start, 
the send you the mimetype(as the format for encoding) 
you create a bucket for that file then respond with an id... 
then intermittently as the frontend is recording, 
they will have a watch event that per 15secs or something 
they retrieve the blob from the api that they are using to do 
the recording an add it to an array then set a timer or something
that when the array has 3 obj init they make a post request to 
the backend with the array of blob and the id that was initially 
sent to them then then you the BE append it to the array you created in memory...
and it continues until the user clicks on stop at which point they 
send you the last blob with a statement that says completed...
then you append the last part to the array encode it into
the initial mimetype that they gave you, then trigger a background process 
that transcribe and save the metadata and the file URL 
to dB at which point you can now return to the frontend when they make the get request
